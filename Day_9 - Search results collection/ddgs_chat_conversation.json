The Assyrian king Sennacherib led a military campaign against the Kingdom of Judah, which included the siege of Jerusalem around 701 BCE.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, including the Bible (2 Kings 18-19, Isaiah 36-37), Sennacherib's forces captured many cities in Judah but were unable to conquer Jerusalem. The siege is notable for the miraculous deliverance of the city, as it is said that an angel of the Lord struck down a large number of Assyrian soldiers, leading Sennacherib to withdraw.\n\nThis event is significant in both biblical history and Assyrian history, illustrating the conflict between the expanding Assyrian Empire and the smaller kingdoms in the region. If you would like more specific information or details about this event, feel free to ask!"
